# RPSByRadost
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, interactive, anf fun "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that can be played in the terminal. The game should allow users to play multiple rounds and provide feedback on the outcome of each round. This project aims to solve the problem of creating an engaging and straightforward way to implement and enjoy a classic game through programming. 

The problem is solved by implementing a text-based "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in Python. The solution involves:
1. User Interaction: The game takes input from the user for their choice (rock, paper, scissors).
2. Random Choice Generation: The game uses the random library to generate a random choice for the computer.
3. Game Logic: The game compares the user's choice to the computer's choice to determine the winner according to the classic rules of "Rock, Paper,  Scissors" game.
4. Input Validation: The game handles invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the user to try again until a valid choice is made.
5. Game Loop: After each round, the game asks the user if they want to play again. If the user chooses "yes", the game continues; if - "no", the game exits.
